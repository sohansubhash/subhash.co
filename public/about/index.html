<h1 id="what-we-do">What We Do</h1>
<p class="callout">We’re a moonshot factory. Our mission is to invent and launch “moonshot” technologies that we hope could someday make the world a radically better place. We have a long way to go before we can fulfill this mission, so today it’s really an ambition.</p>

<p>This is our blueprint for X moonshots: we look for the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. We start with a large problem in the world that if solved could improve the lives of millions or even billions of people. Then we propose a radical solution that sounds impossible today, almost like science fiction. Lastly, we look for a technology breakthrough that exists today; this gives us the necessary hope that the solution we’re looking for is possible, even if its final form is five to ten years away and obscured over the horizon.</p>
<p>We tackle ideas that have the riskiness and ambition of early-stage research and approach them with the focus and speed of a startup. Our goal is to develop and de-risk these early-stage ideas and turn them into proven technologies that make a real impact in the world.</p>
<h1 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h1>
<p class="callout">What if a sculptor and a kite surfer worked together to rethink how we harness the power of the wind? Or if an aerospace engineer and a fashion designer teamed up to bring internet to everyone with balloons?</p>

<p>X is a team of inventors and entrepreneurs from a wide variety of backgrounds. We’re makers, engineers, and scientists with deep technical expertise who’ve come to X to bring our creations out of the lab and into the real world. And we love the challenge of the seemingly impossible and the potential to have an impact on millions of people’s lives. Interested? Come <a href="../join/index.html">join us</a>.</p>
<p>Although we’re a team of diverse thinkers, we don’t have all the answers. So we also work closely with industry experts and commercial partners around the world as we try to solve new problems.</p>
<h1 id="how-we-do-it">How We Do It</h1>
<p class="callout">One of our most important principles is to run as fast as we can at all the hardest parts of a problem, and try to prove that something can’t be done. We want to force ourselves to learn. We actively embrace failure: by making mistakes, we make progress. In this way, our ideas get stronger faster, or we discard them and move on to new ones.</p>

<p>Thousands of ideas last for a few hours, hundreds for a few days, and dozens for a few weeks or months. If the idea survives, then we shape it into a real product. We then work to find the right partners to help us bring the idea into the world. After we’ve created something that we believe can thrive, the <a href="../graduated/index.html">project graduates out of X</a>.</p>        </div>
